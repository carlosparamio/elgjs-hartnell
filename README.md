# Notes

The BASIC programs included here are slightly adapted to allow the specification of user defined graphic characters easily through the usage of backslash escape sequences as described at zmakebas documentation.

For each of the BASIC programs there is a corresponding TAP file that can be used with a Spectrum emulator to run it. However, it is possible to re-create those TAP files easily. The prerequisites to rebuild such TAP files are:
